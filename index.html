        <h3 id="intro">
          Malcolm X was a minister, human rights activist and prominent Black
          nationalist leader who served as a spokesman for the Nation of Islam
          during the 1950s and 1960s. Due largely to his efforts, the Nation of
          Islam grew from a mere 400 members at the time he was released from
          prison in 1952 to 40,000 members by 1960. <br />
          <br />
          A naturally gifted orator, Malcolm X exhorted Black people to cast off
          the shackles of racism "by any means necessary," including violence.
          The fiery civil rights leader broke with the Nation of Islam shortly
          before his assassination in 1965 at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan,
          where he had been preparing to deliver a speech.
